## Getting Started

Instructions on how to start the application.

### Prerequisites

You will need `TypeScript@3.9.4` installed. If you would like to run the production build I
recommend you to install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

To run the application in development mode run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To create a production build of the application run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the build files in the `./build` directory. To start the application using these
files, run:

```bash
serve -s build
```
